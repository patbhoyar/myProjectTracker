                + [NEW] Sort by Project Status (Client Feedback Req, In-Progress, Completed, Archived), then by Project Name
 
SINGLE PROJECT VIEW
                + [UPDATED] On click of Project, should also list "In-Progress, and Approval Needed" tasks. Use "Pending Tasks" as label. If there are none, should show "No Pending Tasks"

                + [UPDATED] Chunk by Project (Show Project labels), Sort by Project Status, similar to Project View (Check Wireframe)
                + Sort projects by Priority, then by Deadline, then by Name
 
ADD A TASK
                + [TO BE CHECKED] All tasks should have Task Approval = No by default; unless the Task was created by a regular user, where Task Approval = Yes
                                + "Task Approval" means Is Task Approval Needed?
 
LOG HOURS
                + [NEW] Add a Task button should allow regular users (and admin) to add tasks
                        + NOTE: If Regular users add tasks, set Task Approval = Yes (by default, cannot be changed)
 
ALSO IMPORTANT: Do you want me to comment on deletion of tasks, projects, etc now, or do you want me to hold off? Let me know.
 
ALSO: REMOVE Actual Completion Date (this should only appear on Edit; And can only be Editted by non-admins once they mark the task as Completed)
 
        PAT: This should be done by the admin, as a user could just say the task is completed, while there may still be bugs.
 
        ROSS: Absolutely, however, I want this to be in the EDIT function for ADMINS only, not during project creation. (I can't mark something as complete when the project just has been created)
